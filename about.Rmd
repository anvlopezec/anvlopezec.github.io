 I am a student of statistics of the National University of Colombia, I love sharing time with the people I love: my family, my boyfriend and my friends.
 

I am a passionate woman for what she does, dreamer and hard-working for the proposed goals, I like to learn new things even if they are not related to what I do, my favorite hobbies are: cooking, traveling, trying new flavors, go to the movies and read fantastic stories.
